## MihawkAI
**AI Engineer**
*July 2025 – Present*

Building production agentic AI systems for enterprise applications.

### Agentic AI Platform Development
Designed and implemented conversational AI systems enabling natural-language interaction with complex data sources:

- **Agentic Architecture:**
  - Built dual-path intent routing (conversational vs data-retrieval execution modes)
  - Implemented multi-stage pipelines (Planner → Executor → Summarizer) for controllable reasoning
  - Developed stateful session management with slot extraction, normalization, and context carryover

- **Tool Orchestration & Retrieval:**
  - Architected tool-service interfaces for search and relational backend integration
  - Designed evidence-grounded generation to minimize hallucinations via bounded context
  - Built deterministic follow-up logic for cost and latency optimization

- **Production Engineering:**
  - Implemented structured output generation (schema-driven) for reliability
  - Built observability infrastructure (tracing, metrics, failure mode capture)
  - Designed guardrails to optimize resource usage across interaction turns

### Computer Vision Systems
- Developed real-time video analysis pipelines for safety-critical applications
- Implemented action recognition models with temporal modeling

**Technologies:** Python, LLM APIs, Agentic AI Patterns, Structured Generation, Tool Calling, Retrieval Systems, Production Observability

## Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA)
**Full-Stack Intern**  
*June 2022 – August 2022*

At GMDA, I played a pivotal role in modernizing the internal dashboard for city planners and administrators:

- **UI/UX Revamp:**
  - Redesigned the dashboard’s frontend using Bootstrap and JavaScript, resulting in a responsive, accessible, and visually cohesive interface across devices and platforms.
  - Prioritized usability improvements to reduce cognitive load and streamline workflows for end users.
- **Backend Integration:**
  - Collaborated with backend engineers to automate data workflows, significantly reducing manual data entry and enhancing operational efficiency.
  - Assisted in developing RESTful APIs to ensure seamless data exchange between the dashboard and backend systems.
- **Project Impact:**
  - The upgraded dashboard accelerated decision-making and improved resource allocation for critical city infrastructure projects.
